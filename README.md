# Depression-Detetction-using-ML-and-DL
A comparitive study on Depression detection using ML models and deep learning models. Some famous ML models are being used and some hybrid Deep learning models are also used here.



Depression is a mood disorder that causes a feeling of sadness and loss of interest. It can take a terrible troll on a person and his/her family.
Depression is a serious sickness which is very common among teenagers and adults. It is spreading rapidly by the use of  social media. It is one of the major reasons for suicide.
Depression and mental illness are key problems in society nowadays. It can occur in people of all age group and can lead to other permanent diseases like anxiety disorders and heart problems
In order to avoid this problem there is a need of a system to detect depression so that it can be prevented.

The problem of depression is spreading rapidly by the use of social media. Hateful comments, tweets, posts, etc targeting a certain someone can give rise to depression.
To solve this issue I come up with a solution to detect depression using twitter tweets so that depression can be prevented before causing significant damage on a person.
I aim to create a deep learning model that can give an individual insight into his or her mental health far earlier than traditional approaches.
There are multiple ways to Detect Depression through text. I am mainly going to focus on Machine learning and Deep learning approaches and their comparative study.
Social media posts provide a rich source and information that can be used to train an efficient deep learning model

This is the workflow of the project:-
